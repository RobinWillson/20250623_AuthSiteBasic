# Concept
I will like to create a ERP system for e-commerce
But let's start by simple step.
We build an authenticate member site first.

This site can let user register and login with google account.
Members will be classified as paid and free.
Free manager can be upgrade to paid member. 
Of course there is admin account that can manager member status.

# website require
- project name : 20250623_AuthSiteBasic
- start by docker
- nodejs base
- react 
- material ui 


# Project Structure

Create a new directory for the project and initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`.

Create the following subdirectories:

* `client`: for the React frontend
* `server`: for the Node.js backend
* `docker`: for Docker configuration files
